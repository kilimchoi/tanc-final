Welcome to TANC

TANC is an acronym for Tibetan Association of Northern California. Our group's main goal is to make a 
user-friendly website for both adminstrators and members of the association. In the next 4 iterations, 
we plan to implement features that help non-members to sign up, members to log into the website and create easy-to-use user-interface for administrators to update, and edit
any information regrading the association. 
We will be primarily using Ruby on Rails to execute these features on top of testing our application with 
cucumber, and rspec.
