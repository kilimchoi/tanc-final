== Welcome to TANC

TANC is an acronym for Tibetan Association of Northern California. Our group's main goal is to make a 
user-friendly website for both adminstrators and members of the association. In the next 4 iterations, 
we plan to implement applications that help non-members to sign up for the website and maintain
existing members on the databse, and create easy-to-use user-interface for administrators to update, and edit any pre-existing
any information regrading the association. 
We will be primarily using Ruby on Rails to execute these features on top of testing our application with 
cucumber, and rspec.
